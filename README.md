# unit-19-react-homework-employee-directory

## Objective 
Build an employee directory webpage from scratch using React. 

## Highlights

* Features a factitious custom logo and color scheme that I designed for this project. 

* Colors pass WCAG AAA Level Contrast Ratio standard for color.

* A design mockup was initially created in [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/RTXniEKvVTicGOcdrVikDd/unit-19-react-homework-employee-directory?node-id=60%3A5) which allowed for rapid experimentation and content creation before jumping into code.

* Employee details are all dynamically mapped from a JSON file. 

    * Employee locations are uniquely linked to Google Maps for NYC, Chicago, Las Vegas and Texas. 

    * Employee phone numbers are able to trigger an actual phone call. (Numbers are factitious) 

    * Email link do all link to unique email addresses, based on the employee's name. (Emails are factitious) 

* React project uses `react-bootstrap`, custom css and `Flexbox` to address styling and make responsive.  



## In Progress

* Fix icon color bug on search bar 

* Center navigation block on tablet size
